# Usage
After downloading, and assuming you have _node_ and _npm_ already installed in your system:

1. `npm install` to install electron and all the dependencies
2. `npm start` to start _gaucho_
3. You can configure your own tasks modifying `tasks.json`
    * Each task is composed of `title` `command` and `path`
